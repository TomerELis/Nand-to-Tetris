# Nand-to-Tetris

A collection of my code from the From Nand to Tetris course, where I’m building a computer from the ground up. starting with the basic NAND gate in HDL, I’ve implemented various other logic gates, progressively.

This repository includes separate HDL code for different logic gates, such as AND, OR, XOR, NOT, and more. Each project focuses on designing a specific gate or system component, providing insight into digital design and hardware architecture.

Currently enrolled in the course on Coursera to gain experience with hardware description languages (HDL).
