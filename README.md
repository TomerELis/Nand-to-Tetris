# Nand-to-Tetris

A collection of my code from the 'Nand to Tetris' course, where Iâ€™m building a computer starting from a basic NAND gate in HDL, gradually developing a complete hardware and software system.

Currently taking the course on Coursera, diving into digital design and hardware description languages (HDL).
